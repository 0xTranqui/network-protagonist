## River

Set information free.

### Background

River facilitates the organization of onchain information in a user friendly way – designed to evoke the feeling of blogs, archives, and databases.

The codebase consists of frontend, backend, and protocol ([separate repo](https://github.com/1ifeworld/river-contracts)) sections that combine to provide the rails for our platform and those who intersect it.

Please see the local development instructions in the README.md for each section. Everything you see is under active development – use code at your own risk.

```bash
