### River

Set information free.

## BACKGROUND

River is a space to manage both individual and group data. It facilitates the onchain organization of existing onchain information in a user friendly way – designed to evoke the feeling of blogs, archives, and databases.

The River codebase consists of three parts – [protocol](https://github.com/1ifeworld/river-contracts), [backend](https://github.com/1ifeworld/river/tree/main/apps/backend), [frontend](https://github.com/1ifeworld/river/tree/main/apps/frontend) – that combine to provide the rails for our platform and those who intersect it. 

Please see the local development instructions in the README.md within the folder for each section. Everything you see here is under active development – use code at your own risk.
